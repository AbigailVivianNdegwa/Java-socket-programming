# Java-socket-programming (Multi-client chat server)

 Description of what i am creating as a question.
 
 Design and implement a multi-client chat server using socket programming in JAVA or any other language of your choice. The server should be capable of accepting connections from multiple clients simultaneously. Each client should be able to send messages to the server, which will then broadcast the messages to all other connected clients. Implement the server using threads to handle communication with each client independently.
